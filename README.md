# BESS PCR Simulation Framework

This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulation framework for reproducing the results of the paper:

**"Impact analysis of different operation strategies for battery energy storage systems providing primary control reserve"**  
*Johannes Fleer, Peter Stenzel, Journal of Energy Storage, 2016.*

## üìå Overview

The code simulates the operation of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) providing **Primary Control Reserve (PCR)** in accordance with the German regulatory framework. It evaluates how different operational strategies‚Äî**overfulfillment**, **deadband utilization**, and **scheduled energy transactions**‚Äîaffect BESS performance in terms of:

- Energy throughput
- State of Charge (SOC) distribution
- Full Cycle Equivalents (FCE)
- Schedule energy exchange

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. **Environment Requirements**
- MATLAB R2018b or newer (earlier versions may work)
- Statistics and Signal Processing Toolboxes (optional, for plotting)

### 2. **Running a Simulation**

Open `runBESS_PCR_Model.m` in MATLAB and execute:

```matlab
runBESS_PCR_Model
```

This will:
- Load frequency data from `FreqDataRep.mat`
- Load parameters via `BESS_Parameters.m`
- Simulate BESS behavior with selected operational strategies
- Output key metrics such as total energy throughput, FCE, and SOC distributions
- Optionally visualize results (see next section)

## üß© Simulation Parameters

You can modify the following options inside `BESS_Parameters.m`:

- **Battery Size & Power**: `C`, `PPQ`
- **Charge/Discharge Efficiencies**: `eta_ch`, `eta_dis`
- **SOC Ranges** for:
  - Overfulfillment (`SOC1_low`, `SOC1_high`)
  - Deadband utilization (`SOC2_low`, `SOC2_high`)
  - Scheduled transactions (`SOC3_low`, `SOC3_high`)
- **Schedule Parameters**: power `P_ST`, duration `dt_contract`
- **Simulation Duration**: full year vs. limited test period

---

## üìà Output & Visualization

Simulation results include:

- `FCE`: Full Cycle Equivalents per year
- `DEST`, `DEOF`, `DEDU`: Energy exchanged via transaction, overfulfillment, or deadband
- `SOC_hist`: SOC histogram over time
- `E_rate_dist`: Distribution of E-rates (C-rate proxy)

Use `BESS_Visualization.m` to plot:

```matlab
plotSOCDistribution(SOC_vector);
plotEnergyFlows(DEST, DEOF, DEDU);
```

## üß† Extensions

- Couple with detailed **battery degradation models** using DoD-sensitive metrics
- Extend to multi-BESS aggregation or hybrid systems (e.g., wind + BESS)
- Port to Python or Simulink for real-time or embedded simulation
